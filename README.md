I used the jGRASP IDE to write, compile, and execute my code. After running the program and using phw_input.txt
(with whatever comma-delimited values you want, I chose 1-10) the console will print the MSCS values for each
of the four algorithms, and then put all of the values in an output file named "CourtneyStewart_phw_output.txt"


I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. I did not copy whole or parts of it from another student or have 
another person write the code for me. Any code I am reusing in my program is clearly marked as such with its 
source clearly identified in comments.
